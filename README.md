# quicksort

Hi there! This is my study implementation of the quicksort algorithm written on Go.

As it is a study, I do not plan to look at another implementations prior finishing.  
My plan is to minimize memory allocation and speed of the implementation.

Any comments? Write me to kaatinga@gmail.com
